  <p>In a world defined by cut throat competition, with no one really looking out for you; How do you shine with the skills that you have?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to the crazy ones.<br>
The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.<br>
The round pegs in the square holes.<br>
The ones who see things differently.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.<br>
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.<br>
About the only thing you can&rsquo;t do is ignore them.<br>
Because they change things.</p>
<p>They push the human race forward.<br>
And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<br>
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="https://fs.blog/2016/03/steve-jobs-crazy-ones/"><em>Rob Siltanen</em></a></p>
<h1 id="self-confidence">Self-Confidence</h1>
<p>The belief that regardless of the odds and regardless of how improbable and impossible it seems, you alone are enough to achieve what you aim to do.</p>
<p><em>(noun)​ confidence in yourself and your abilities</em></p>
<p><strong>Repetition</strong><br>
The master has failed more times that the apprentice has even tried.<br>
Persistence, with iterative learning is the key to building your self confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Tenacity &amp; Grit</strong><br>
It is easy to give up when the going gets tough, when there is no light at the end of the tunnel.<br>
Build your mental fortitude to go beyond the times that you think is reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Talk</strong><br>
There are enough people in the world telling you that you can&rsquo;t do it; why should you be one of them?<br>
While avoiding the hubris, remind yourself in the quiet times about who you are and what made you.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Affirmation</strong><br>
For those times of self doubt, write-up a brag sheet to show you what you have achieved and what you have done.<br>
Reaffirm the positives to tide over the feelings of doubt. Push through those patches of self doubt and win to build further on your self confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Your company</strong><br>
Run from the people who tear you down and tell you that you are not good enough.<br>
And in the cases you can avoid them, tune them out and fall back on self affirmation.<br>
No one knows you as well as you know yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Catch them when they are good!</strong><br>
Avoid correcting people when they make a less than ideal impression. Show them and yourself when you are doing something right.</p>
<p><strong>Interpret Feedback</strong><br>
See the possibilities in the feedback and take feedback the way you want to take it.<br>
Do not let feedback cow you down. Work hard, but remember you know yourself far better than anyone else who is giving you feedback.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HYZv6HzAs">thoughts adapted from the linked tedx talk</a></p>
<p>For those times when your self doubt becomes limiting:</p>
<p>Reference Check</p>
<p>Prasanth Abraham</p>
<p>18th August 2017</p>
<hr>
<p>We are taking this reference in order to verify employment details for Prasanth – are you comfortable for the contents of this document to be shared should Prasanth wish to see it?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Can you confirm your role and responsibilities?</p>
<hr>
<p>Can you confirm the nature of your relationship with Prasanth?</p>
<p>He was a Functional Consultant and he was a contractor to &mdash; through the outsource company.</p>
<p>How long have you known him?</p>
<p>6 – 12 months it would be safe to say.</p>
<p>What was Prasanth’s position and responsibilities whilst you worked with him?</p>
<p>So he was responsible for delivering new functionality - &mdash; it was called. &mdash;&mdash;&ndash;. I am the business owner and he was the lead IT owner. The way it works is that the Functional Consultant is the link between the business and the developers.</p>
<p>Can you describe his effectiveness in this role?</p>
<p>In short, he is the best Functional Consultant we have had. When he left I thought, there is a massive hole. We sacked the second one that replaced him. I thought, ‘why did that happen? Is it because Prasanth set such a high standard?’ He was the best that we have had in that space.</p>
<p>What are his biggest strengths?</p>
<p>Attention to detail and understanding the process that we are trying to achieve rather than just the details of how to get it done. He came back with suggestions that I hadn’t thought of. He’s very strategic, holistic and gets the big picture. Some IT people come back and say ‘We have delivered to the acceptance criteria’. I am not here to negotiate acceptance criteria – I am here to get a result. And I never had those conversations with Prasanth. That is what made him so good. His communication is very strong as well. He’s a team player.</p>
<p>Can you comment on any weaknesses?</p>
<p>He works too hard. His work / life balance is out of whack. He was on holiday and he took four hours out of his holiday to sort out an issue – I didn’t expect that. I was like, “Prasanth, what are you doing here?’ on a webex.</p>
<p>Can you comment on any particular achievements that stand out for you during his time with you?</p>
<p>He built something very complex and did a great job with it.</p>
<p>What do you think Prasanth enjoyed doing most?</p>
<p>I got the sense that he enjoyed and took pride in his work. He enjoyed delivering something that added value and when you gave him positive feedback at the end, you knew he had done a good job.</p>
<p>What do you think Prasanth enjoyed doing the least?</p>
<p>Nothing that I could tell – he was just so efficient and communicated so well that I never saw any frustrations really.</p>
<p>What are his reasons for leaving?</p>
<p>I am not sure.</p>
<p>How did he get on with the rest of the team?</p>
<p>From what I could tell they respected him for his ethics and his skills. Both our Architect and the person who manages our contractors raved about Prasanth. Their conversations would go up a level in understanding and speed with Prasanth. He had done his homework.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical situation, would you re-employ him?</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>Prasanth has applied for a position as a Functional Salesforce Consultant. He will be working end-to-end, from requirements elicitation, analysis and design through to hands-on configuration. Do you think he would be suitable for this?</p>
<p>Yes I do. Getting requirements is his strength – he is detailed and gets what he needs out of people. I haven’t seen him run a workshop but I have spent lots of time with him where he has gotten requirements from me.</p>
<p>Was he punctual?</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>How was his attendance?</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Has Prasanth’s honesty ever been called into question?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What is your favourite memory of Prasanth – preferably something more personal?</p>
<p>Probably the fact that he turned up on his holiday to solve a problem for us – I was blown away by his commitment. That’s probably my favourite memory.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that you would like to add?</p>
<p>No. I just think you have done well to find and recruit him.</p>
