# Travel

A road stretches and seems endless
For those who never wander far
In life how many steps will they take
For some, like going to the moon
I have journeyed and travelled it, partly
along its many winding ways
But always returning to where I started
I like the many who set out to roam
Just ended up coming back to my home.
