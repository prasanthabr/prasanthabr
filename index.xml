      <description>OCD Neil Hilborn
The first time I saw her&amp;hellip; Everything in my head went quiet. All the tics, all the constantly refreshing images just disappeared. When you have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, you don’t really get quiet moments. Even in bed, I’m thinking: Did I lock the doors? Yes. Did I wash my hands? Yes. Did I lock the doors? Yes. Did I wash my hands? Yes. But when I saw her, the only thing I could think about was the hairpin curve of her lips.</description>

      <description>Ulysses Alfred Lord Tennyson
It little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel; I will drink Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea.</description>

      <description>See It Through Edgar Albert Guest
When you’re up against a trouble,
Meet it squarely, face to face;
Lift your chin and set your shoulders,
Plant your feet and take a brace.
When it’s vain to try to dodge it,
Do the best that you can do;
You may fail, but you may conquer,
See it through!
Black may be the clouds about you
And your future may seem grim,</description>

      <description>This is a short blog that I wrote for my then employer; the journey and the writeup was possible because of the kindness of many people - the words more so by Jono&amp;rsquo;s
 It has been a little over two years since I came over to New Zealand from India (the finest country in the world in spite of its chaos, heat and noise, or, on second thoughts, precisely because of that – NZ comes a close second, of course!</description>

      <description>For someone without the computer science background
Knowing what a Function, Procedure and Method technically means:
A function returns a value
A procedure does not return a value
A method is similar to a function is part of a Class. Methods are used almost exclusively in Object Oriented Programming

      <description>In a world defined by cut throat competition, with no one really looking out for you; How do you shine with the skills that you have?
 Here&amp;rsquo;s to the crazy ones.
The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes.
The ones who see things differently.
They&amp;rsquo;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.</description>

      <description>Copied over for posterity from: https://neilkakkar.com/powerful-life-skills.html
10 Powerful Life Skills for the New Decade Jan 2, 2021 • Life
Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.
These are rare skills, responsible for making them who they are. Most normal people, including me, don’t realise it. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</description>

      <description>of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine&amp;hellip;
  Nothing really matters, unless you want it to.
   We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</description>

      <description>Si tú me olvidas (Spanish) Neruda, Pablo Quiero que sepas una cosa.
Tú sabes cómo es esto: si miro la luna de cristal, la rama roja del lento otoño en mi ventana, si toco junto al fuego la impalpable ceniza o el arrugado cuerpo de la leña, todo me lleva a ti, como si todo lo que existe, aromas, luz, metales, fueran pequeños barcos que navegan hacia las islas tuyas que me aguardan.</description>

Random thoughts on Apex development
  Avoid deeply nexted if statements &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; find a pattern that should be used in a cascade of checks?
  Small functions with easily testable inputs and outputs &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; what are functions here? Are these methods?
  Fast Tests &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; meaning short tests that execute quickly
  Good balance between abstraction and implementation &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; have no clue what this means?</description>
