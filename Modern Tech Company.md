# Modern Tech Company  

Modern Tech Companies are certain common characteristics  
These companies are different from the older companies that thrived on huge capital infusion, long gestation developments

Key observable characteristics  
1. Industry transformation
   Firms want to try to change the fundamentals of an industry at scale
   Firms define a new paradigm for the industry
   Eg: Google -> how people find things, LinkedIn/Facebook -> how people connect, Uber -> how people travel

2. Low Capital _read more on this aspect_ yet valuable local assets
    In its simplest form, it shows that firms can make an impact with lower capital outlay
    Often companies do not even have an owned office space or other assets that they own
    Note: the impact is very local and need not be global

3. Customer intimacy
    Modern Companies have customer insights that are valuable
    They understand their customers intimately - with insights that an outsider cannot easily gather

4. Network effect
   Companies increase their value of stakeholders with every addition to their network
   1. Direct Network effect
        Every addition directly contributes to value.
        When everyone is on whatsapp - there is value in being one more person on whatsapp
   2. Indirect Network effect
        Two parts of the market would contribute to each other
        More suppliers, more value to a single customer; more customers, more value to a single supplier

5. Ecosystem that boosts expansion
    Moving into related products to subscribe to an ecosystem

6. Variable cost and margins
    The costs of operations vary in the different industries that they operarte.
    Growth at a fast clip is one of the requirements of a tech company, since larger scale provides for better bargaining capacity, which allows for more manageable costs and better margins.
