# Design is messy

The way we approach #messiness
- ignore it
  - measured with: novelty of vision, individual charisma, technical mastery
  - [[gesamtkunstwek]] or total design on what can be controlled
    - everything that is designed affects its environment and is affected by things outside the environment
    - CON: [[Mark Wibly]] - total design is a control fantasy
- abstract it - simplifying


Key Things I Noted:
- Design Council 2005
- DSchool
- Deloittes Agile landscape
- David Kelly
- Future Wheels
- [[VUCA]] - structured definition of #Chaos
- [[pattern recognition]]
- [[actor network theory]]
- [[solution entropy]] - we solve nothing, we move the problem or change things.
